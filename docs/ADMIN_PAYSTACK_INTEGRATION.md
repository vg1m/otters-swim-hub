## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Payment Data Flow

1. **User completes Paystack checkout**
2. **Webhook updates database**:
   - `payments` table: `status = 'completed'`, `payment_channel`, `paystack_reference`
   - `invoices` table: `status = 'paid'`, `paid_at`
   - `receipts` table: New receipt generated
   - `swimmers` table: `status = 'approved'`

3. **Admin views data**:
   - **Invoices page**: Joins `payments` to show channel and reference
   - **Reports page**: Queries `payments` directly for transaction details
   - **Dashboard**: Shows aggregated stats

### Database Relationships

```
invoices
  ├── payments (one-to-many)
  ├── swimmers (one-to-one via swimmer_id)
  ├── invoice_line_items (one-to-many)
  └── receipts (one-to-one)
```
