## Testing Checklist

### ✅ Can Test Now (Without Payment)
- [x] Landing page loads
- [x] Navigation works (desktop/mobile)
- [x] Login/Signup UI
- [x] Admin dashboard UI
- [x] All forms and inputs
- [x] Responsive design
- [x] Table filtering and sorting

### ⏳ Can Test After Supabase Setup
- [ ] User authentication
- [ ] Role-based access
- [ ] Swimmer registration (without payment)
- [ ] Admin approval workflow
- [ ] Invoice creation
- [ ] Session creation
- [ ] QR code generation
- [ ] Manual attendance marking

### ⏳ Can Test After Paystack Setup
- [ ] End-to-end registration with payment
- [ ] Invoice payment flow
- [ ] Receipt generation
- [ ] Payment confirmations

## Next Steps

### Immediate (To Get Running)
1. **Add Supabase credentials** to `.env.local`
2. **Restart dev server**: `npm run dev`
3. **Test authentication** (login/signup)
4. **Create first admin user** in Supabase
5. **Test admin features** (sessions, invoices)

### Soon (Payment Integration)
1. **Get Paystack credentials**
2. **Create new payment integration**:
   ```bash
   lib/payments/paystack.js
   app/api/paystack/initialize/route.js
   app/api/paystack/callback/route.js
   ```
3. **Update registration flow** to use Paystack
4. **Update invoice payment** to use Paystack
5. **Test payment flow** end-to-end

### Later (Enhancements)
1. Configure PWA for offline support
2. Add app icons (192x192, 512x512)
3. Test PWA install on mobile
4. Deploy to Vercel
5. Set up custom domain

## Code Quality

### Architecture Patterns Used
- **Server/Client Components** - Proper separation
- **Custom Hooks** - Reusable logic (useAuth, useSwimmers, useInvoices)
- **Component Library** - Consistent UI (Button, Card, Input, etc.)
- **Utility Functions** - Currency, dates, receipts
- **API Route Handlers** - Secure server-side operations
- **Middleware** - Authentication protection

### Best Practices Applied
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Semantic HTML
- Accessible forms (labels, ARIA)
- Loading states everywhere
- Error handling with toast notifications
- Protected API routes
- Environment variable security
- Database indexes for performance

## Performance Considerations

### Implemented
- ✅ Tailwind CSS tree-shaking (production)
- ✅ Next.js automatic code splitting
- ✅ Image optimization ready (remotePatterns)
- ✅ Database indexes on foreign keys
- ✅ Efficient queries with select specific fields
- ✅ Component lazy loading (modals)

### Future Optimizations
- Server-side caching for sessions
- Optimistic UI updates
- Image lazy loading
- Infinite scroll for large lists

## Known Limitations

1. **Email Sending**: Not implemented yet (requires Supabase email config or SendGrid/Resend)
2. **Meet Management**: Basic structure only (not fully built out)
3. **Reports**: Dashboard placeholder only (no detailed reports yet)
4. **QR Scanner**: Uses basic camera API (could upgrade to dedicated QR library)
5. **Receipt Email**: PDF generation works, email sending pending

## Migration Notes

### From Prisma to Supabase
- Migration script ready: `supabase/migrate-from-prisma.js`
- Requires both databases accessible
- Creates parent profiles from unique phone numbers
- Links swimmers to parents
- Copies meet data
- Run with: `node supabase/migrate-from-prisma.js`

### Clean Up After Migration
```bash
# Delete Prisma files (after confirming migration)
rm -rf prisma/
rm package.json entries for @prisma/client, prisma
```

## Success Metrics Achieved
